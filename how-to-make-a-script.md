# How to make a script

## Prerequisites
- A code editor or IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio)
- Some basic JS/TS experience to learn how the language works
- The definitions for autocomplete/checking

If you plan to debug using the Visual Studio workspace, click [here](https://.com/LatiteScripting/Scripts/blob/master/docs/debugging.md) (you need to install VS first though).  
### Useful info for JS/TS

## Setting up the workspace
Using JS with autocomplete (do //@ts-check at the top of the document) or TS is highly recommended.

You must put the definitions in the workspace for autocomplete/checking.

## OK, I did that, what now?
It's time to make some scripts!

You can debug your code using the Visual Studio workspace.
