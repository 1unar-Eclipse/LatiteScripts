## Latite Scripting

The Latite Scripting API allows the community to add custom features (like mods and commands) to the client. 

Latite's scripting API uses JavaScript. To be able to use scripts, you need to have Latite Beta. Join the discord for more information.

## How to get your script added
For now, you can request your script to be added in [#beta-chat](https://discord.com/channels/885656043521179680/1058027973065842698) in the Discord server. You must have a GitHub repository that contains your script. Your script will **NOT** auto update in this repository for security reasons. We will check your code and update it in this repostiory every once in awhile

## Using the .script command in game
To install those scripts, run `.script install <scriptname>` ingame. For example, do `.script install chatlogger` to install the ChatLogger script.

## Cloning this repository
Cloning this repository is a good way to get scripts.

Use this command to clone the repository and all scripts inside it:
```console
git clone https://github.com/LatiteScripting/Scripts.git --recursive
```

## Debugging

You can [debug your scripts](https://github.com/LatiteScripting/Scripts/tree/master/docs/debugging.md) in Latite Client using Visual Studio.
