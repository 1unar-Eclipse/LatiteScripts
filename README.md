## How to get your script added
For now, you can request your script to be added in [#beta-chat](https://discord.com/channels/885656043521179680/1058027973065842698) in the Discord server. You must have a GitHub repository that contains your script. Your script will **NOT** auto update in this repository for security reasons. We will check your code and update it in this repostiory every once in awhile

## Cloning this repository
Cloning this repository is a good way to get scripts.

Use this command to clone the repository and all scripts inside it:
```console
git clone git@github.com:LatiteScripting/Scripts.git --recursive
```
